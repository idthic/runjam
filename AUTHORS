# The "hydrojet" was a package of ideal hydro + cascade model.  Later
# the module for the Cooper-Frye sampling is rewritten from scratch by
# KM to support the viscous correction of distribution function.
# Recently (as of 2015+) only this Cooper-Frye sampling codes and the
# invokation code of JAM is used for dynamical calculations.  To
# reduce the complexity and promote portability, only this part is
# extracted as a standalone program.
